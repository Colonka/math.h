# math.h

My own implementation of the math.h library in C programming language

## Introduction

In this project I've developed my own version of the standard math.h library in the C programming language. This library implements basic mathematical operations, which are then used in various algorithms.

## Information

C mathematical operations are a group of functions in the standard library of the C programming language implementing basic mathematical functions. All functions use floating-point numbers in one manner or another. Different C standards provide different, albeit backwards-compatible, sets of functions. Any functions that operate on angles use radians as the unit of angle.

## Instruction for running

Being in math.h/src folder run command `make` in terminal that create static library s21_math. Then include s21_math.h in your file and link s21_math while compilation of your source files.

`#include "<Directory where the header resides>/s21_math.h"`

`-L<Directory where the library resides> -l<library name>`

## Documentation

To open library documentation run command `make dvi` in terminal being in math.h/src folder.

### Overview of some "math.h" functions

| No. | Function | Description |
| --- | -------- | ----------- |
| 1 | `int abs(int x)` | computes absolute value of an integer value |
| 2 | `long double acos(double x)` | computes arc cosine |
| 3 | `long double asin(double x)` | computes arc sine |
| 4 | `long double atan(double x)` | computes arc tangent |
| 5 | `long double ceil(double x)` | returns the nearest integer not less than the given value |
| 6 | `long double cos(double x)` | computes cosine |
| 7 | `long double exp(double x)` | returns e raised to the given power |
| 8 | `long double fabs(double x)` | computes absolute value of a floating-point value |
| 9 | `long double floor(double x)` | returns the nearest integer not greater than the given value |
| 10 | `long double fmod(double x, double y)` | remainder of the floating-point division operation |
| 11 | `long double log(double x)` | computes natural logarithm |
| 12 | `long double pow(double base, double exp)` | raises a number to the given power |
| 13 | `long double sin(double x)` | computes sine |
| 14 | `long double sqrt(double x)` | computes square root |
| 15 | `long double tan(double x)` | computes tangent |
